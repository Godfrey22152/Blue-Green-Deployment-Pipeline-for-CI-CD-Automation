## Infrastructure Setup

### CI: AWS EC2 Instance for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus


#### Manual Procedure for AWS EC2 Instance setup for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus

##### First Option: Using AWS Management Console

Set up three AWS EC2 instances for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
Launch 3 EC2 instances (Ubuntu) in AWS but ensure you add these user-data for each instance during creation to install necessary dependencies.

- **User Data for EC2 Instance dependency installation**:

To add the **User Data** script during the EC2 instance creation, follow these steps:

   - **Log in to AWS Management Console** and navigate to **EC2**.
   - Click on **Launch Instance**.
   - Choose the **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** and **Instance Type**, then proceed to **Configure Instance Details**.
   - Scroll down to the **Advanced Details** section.
   - In the **User data** field, add your script or commands:
   
   - **For Jenkins:**
   ```bash  
    #!/bin/bash

    # Update the package list
    sudo apt-get update -y

    # Install Java
    sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jre-headless

    # Jenkins installation process
    echo "Installing Jenkins package..."
    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y jenkins

    # Docker installation
    echo "Installing Docker..."
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

    sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

    # Trivy installation
    echo "Installing Trivy..."
    wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.27.1/trivy_0.27.1_Linux-64bit.deb
    sudo dpkg -i trivy_0.27.1_Linux-64bit.deb
   ```

   - **For SonarQube:**
   ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update

    ## Install Docker
    yes | sudo apt-get install docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
    echo "Waiting for 30 seconds before runing Sonarqube Docker container..."
    sleep 30

    ## Runing Sonarqube in a docker container
    docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name sonarqube-container sonarqube:lts-community
   ```
   - **For Nexus:**
   ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update

    ## Install Docker
    yes | sudo apt-get install docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
    echo "Waiting for 30 seconds before running Nexus Docker container..."
    sleep 30

    ## Runing Nexus in a docker container
    docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus-container sonatype/nexus3:latest
   ```

   - Continue with the remaining steps to configure **Storage**, **Security Groups**, and **Tags**, then launch the instance.


##### Second Option: Using AWS CLI to setup the EC2 Instances
You can also use the `AWS CLI` to setup each of the EC2 Instance:

   ```bash
    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --instance-type t2.medium --key-name your-key-pair \
    --security-group-ids sg-12345678 --subnet-id subnet-12345678 --user-data file://userdata.sh
   ```

- **NOTE**:
 - `--image-id ami-12345678`: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID to use for the instance. This ID represents the OS and software configuration of the instance (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux).

 - `--instance-type t2.medium`: Specifies the type of instance to create, which determines its CPU, memory, and network performance. `t2.medium` provides moderate resources suitable for small to medium workloads. (You should increase the size for Jenkins instance.)

 - `--key-name your-key-pair`: Specifies the name of the key pair to use for SSH access to the instance. You should have created this key pair in advance within AWS EC2.

 - `--security-group-ids sg-12345678`: Assigns the instance to a security group that controls inbound and outbound traffic rules. Security groups are configured with rules to allow or restrict network access.

 - `--subnet-id subnet-12345678`: Specifies the subnet where the instance will be launched. The subnet should be part of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in which the instance can access resources and network configurations.

 - `--user-data file://userdata.sh`: Supplies the user data script (`userdata.sh` in this case) that will run automatically when the instance starts. If the userdata.sh is in the same directory where youâ€™re running the command, you can reference it as `file://userdata.sh`. Otherwise, provide the full path, e.g., `file:///home/user/scripts/userdata.sh`.


#### Automated setup for the AWS EC2 Instance for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus
 For a fully automated setup of the EC2 Instances using Terraform: 
 Refer to the [Terraform EC2 Setup](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/automation-of-aws-infra-using-terraform-via-Gitlab) for automated setup scripts.


### Configure Installed Tools: `Jenkins`, `SonarQube`, and `Nexus`

### Jenkins
 
Access running `Jenkins` and complete the setup over the browser using the EC2 Instance server `Public IP` at `http://<public-ip>:8080`.
   
- **Access Jenkins Initial Admin Password**:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```

- **create an account to sign in and Install recommended Plugins**

### SonarQube

- **Access running SonarQube server at `http://<public-ip>:9000`**
- **SonarQube Initial Admin Password Credentials**:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin`


### Nexus 
- **Access running Nexus server at `http://<public-ip>:8081`**  
- **Access Nexus Credentials**:
  The default admin password is stored in a file inside the container. Retrieve it by accessing container shell:

     ```bash
     docker exec nexus-container cat /nexus-data/admin.password
     ```


### CD: EKS Cluster Setup
Refer to the repository and guide **[here](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Automated-EKS-Cluster-Deployment-Pipeline/tree/main/aws_eks_terraform_files)** for setting up your EKS cluster using terraform. 
 
- **Before you run the terraform scripts**: 
Ensure you have `terraform`, `AWS CLI`, and `kubectl` installed on the server which you will use to create the cluster:

```bash
# Terraform Installation
echo "Installing Terraform..."
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.6.5/terraform_1.6.5_linux_386.zip
sudo apt-get install -y unzip
unzip terraform_1.6.5_linux_386.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
```
```bash
# Install Kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl 
```
```bash
# Install AWS CLI 
sudo apt install unzip 
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

- **After Installation, Run**: 
```bash
aws configure
# Follow the prompts and provide your "Access key ID" and "Secret Access Key" 
```


**You can also refer to this repository and guide [here](https://github.com/Godfrey22152/Automated-EKS-Cluster-Deployment-Pipeline.git) for automated cluster creation.**


**After setting up, connect to the cluster with**:
```bash
aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>

# In our case  
aws eks --region eu-west-1 update-kubeconfig --name odo-eks-cluster
```

### Service Account & Secrets for Jenkins
Create a `service account` in the `webapps` `Namespace` and necessary `secrets` for Jenkins to connect to the EKS cluster:
Use the provided scripts in the **[Jenkins_ServiceAccount_RBAC_Scripts](./Jenkins_ServiceAccount_RBAC_Scripts)** folder for automating service account and secret creation. You can refer to the detailed `README.md` inside the folder.
- Run the automated script `create_jenkins_rbac.sh` available in the `Jenkins_ServiceAccount_RBAC_Scripts` folder in the repository.
- After creating the secrets, copy the secret as displayed on the screen, add them to Jenkins by navigating to `Manage Jenkins` > `Credentials`. (Select `secret text` and paste the secret)
